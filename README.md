# LaunchDarkly Funnel Experiment Runner
This is likely not useful for you to copy and run! It's a script I created to run a highly specific funnel experiment, which contains three primary funnel steps and two secondary metrics to track along the way.

Feel free to peruse and reach out if you have questions on what I did and why :)

For what it's worth, `.env.example` has exactly the values (except my SDK key) I used to get these results:
